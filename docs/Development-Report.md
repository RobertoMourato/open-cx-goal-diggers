Welcome to the documentation pages of the **openCX- UpQuestion** project!

You can find here detailed information about the project, from a high-level product vision to low-level implementation decisions, organized as a kind of Software Development Report

## Product Vision

To make great questions heard (by the speaker)


## Elevator Pitch

Tired of the long awkward silences when speaker asks "Any questions??"; Tired of hearing the front line old lady telling her life story taking up your question space? Don't worry!! Send us your questions and upvote your favorites. Make your voice heard without the hassle of waiting for a mic.


## Requirements


UpQuestion was designed to end up with the inefficient experience of the participants in a conference at the end moment when questions are made/answered.

The main stakeholders identified in the given context are:

* The Participant- Person who attend to listen the speaker in   a certain talk. Has the capability to Submit questions and   to upvote other participants questions he thinks deserve     being answered.

* The Speaker- Person expert on the subject who performs the   talk. Has limited time to answer an, also, limited number     of questions and intend to invest that time to answer the     most interesting questions.

We believe that a communitarian forum open to all conference participants with features of upvote is our greatest ally to cluster the greatest questions, those that will be answered in that limited period.

A more detailed analysis of this topic is made below targeting RUP & AGILE methodologies of requirement engineering:

## Tasks Management Tools
To communicate more efficiently we chose to use **Trello**  as our main tool of tasks management. User Stories with their BDD text, User Case Diagram and the work flow can be found [there](https://trello.com/b/08Qa7QyI).
